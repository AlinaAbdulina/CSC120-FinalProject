# CSC120-FinalProject

## Deliverables:
 - Your final codebase
 - Your revised annotated architecture diagram
 - Design justification (including a brief discussion of at least one alternative you considered)
 - A map of your game's layout (if applicable)
 - `cheatsheet.md`
 - Completed `rubric.md`
  
## Additional Reflection Questions
 - What was your **overall approach** to tackling this project?
 - What **new thing(s)** did you learn / figure out in completing this project?
 - Is there anything that you wish you had **implemented differently**?
 - If you had **unlimited time**, what additional features would you implement?
 - What was the most helpful **piece of feedback** you received while working on your project? Who gave it to you?
 - If you could go back in time and give your past self some **advice** about this project, what hints would you give?
 - _If you worked with a team:_ please comment on how your **team dynamics** influenced your experience working on this project.

Our overall approach was once we decided on the project we discussed what we would need such as classes. We knew that Barista, Cafe, Customer, and Coffee where necessary. Anastasija specifically had an idea on the story line so she started on Customer. While Bella started on Cafe and Alina did Barista. We made sure we had a layout before our first meeting. Because we were a team working with live edits, we coded on one computer (projected on a screen) in the beginning. In the future given more time, our game would have more graphics, nuanced reactions, and specific customers. We believe one of the best features we learned from this final project was integrating images and graphics within our code.
The most helpful piece of advice would be to plan a set time to work in a group because it should not be done alone. When we sat in the library together we found it to be more productive than working alone, especially admist final exam season. Our team dynamic was very productive! We established open communication whenever an edit was made to the code and in doing so we were able to talk about what worked and what didn't. We realized the importance of group building by the end of this final project!
