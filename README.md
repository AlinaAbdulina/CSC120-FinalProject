Our overal aproacj was once we decided on the project we disucsed what we would need such as classes. We knew that Barista, Cafe, Customer, and Coffee where nessecary. Anastasija specifically had an idea on the story line so she started on Customer. While Bella started on Cafe and Alina did Barista. We made sure we had sometype of layout before our first meeting. After that we meet up in person and coded on one computer. We talked through our problems and decided the next line of code together. If we of had unlimited time we would have added more graphis, reactions, and customers. On ething we would chnage is that for some reason on Alina's computer the graphics popup without clicking on them but on the other computers we have to click on the image. The most helpful feedback would be to make a set time to work in a group because it should not be done alone. When we sat in the library together we got the most work done. My advice would be set a time early to work with your group especially if you have many final exams. That will help you have flexibility of when you can work on the project. Our team dynamics helped us work together because none of us were trying to do the project on our own. At first we did a simple base layer on our own. When we where together is when we did the most work.
The best thing we learned was how to add images and graphis within our code.
