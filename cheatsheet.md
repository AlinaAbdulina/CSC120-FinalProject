Welcome to Cafe Cafe!
You are a barista at a not so normal cafe... But you got hired because you seemed like you could handle it. As the day goes on you will encounter a variety of people all with different personalities and orders, it's up to you to decide how you want to handle them! 
Cafe Cafe takes the following commands: 
1. Your name at the beginning of the game.
2. The drink served, `Enter` key, or "auto".
3. A numerical value corresponding to a reaction.
4. "yes" or "no".

Cafe Cafe highly recommends you serve `finalBoss` incorrectly. Enjoy!
